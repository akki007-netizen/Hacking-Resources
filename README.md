# Hacking-Resources
A wide range of tools and what they do, along with how to use them guide, for penetration testing.

This repository is for fellow pentesters, who want to keep others secure.
There are 5 stages of pentesting:
1) Reconnaissance
2) Scanning and Enumeration
3) Exploitation
4) Maintaining Access
5) Covering Tracks

The tools will be based on these above topics.

But one should remember, to pursue a strong career in CYBERSECURITY, you should really good networking concepts and good soft skills too...
A technical tool will only get you till a certain level. Again what use is your skill, if you can't explain how you did it?

I will try and explain every stage in simple words, words so simple that even babies can understand...
